        The Launceston data project was developed as my final project for the 
        <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/">CS50(x)</a> course, taken through 
        <a href="https://www.edx.org/.../introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">
        edX</a>. This course is described as "an introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science 
        and the art of programming" and I highly recommend it to those who may be interested.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project brings together various publicly available datasets related to the 
        City of Launceston in Northern Tasmania. Data displayed on the site includes:
    </p><br>
    <ul>
        <li>NAPLAN data for all Launceston Primary Schools</li>
        <li>A map layer showing the three local government zones that cover Launceston</li>
        <li>A map layer showing the heritage listed buildings within the Launceston City Council area</li>
        <li>A map layer showing the school 'catchment' zones for the public schools of Launceston</li>
        <li>A map layer showing the suburb/locality boundaries for the greater Launceston area</li>
        <!-- <li>A map layer showing the most recent Federal election polling booths for Bass</li> -->
    </ul><br>
    <p>
        Data for the project has been drawn from various sources, including:
